1. Requirement Analysis and Planning (1 Day)
Understand the task requirements, objectives, and workflow.
Plan the code structure, database schema, and file generation logic.
2. Environment Setup and Configuration (3 Days)
Install and configure:
JDK for Java development.
Tomcat Server for deployment.
Oracle Database and set up the ACHHEADER table schema.
Set up JDBC drivers and file directory paths.
Validate the connectivity between the code, database, and filesystem.
3. Core Development (6 Days)
3.1 ACHCR_Validation.java (4 Days)
Develop database connection logic and query execution.
Implement the TimerTask to schedule file processing every 2 minutes.
Build methods for:
Fetching rows with FILE_STATUS = 10.
Updating FILE_STATUS and other fields in the database.
Handling successful and failed file generation scenarios.
3.2 ReturnFileGenerator_seq.java (2 Days)
Create methods to:
Generate return files dynamically based on ACHHEADER IDs.
Ensure directory existence and handle file-writing errors.
Write reusable methods to manage file operations.
4. Testing (3 Days)
4.1 Unit Testing (1.5 Days)
Validate each method independently:
Database query execution.
File creation logic.
Status update queries.
Use mock database setups if necessary.
4.2 Integration Testing (1.5 Days)
Simulate end-to-end processing:
Insert test records into the ACHHEADER table with FILE_STATUS = 10.
Trigger the application and monitor the file generation and database updates.
5. Debugging and Optimization (2 Days)
Address issues from the testing phase.
Optimize query performance and file I/O operations.
Add proper exception handling and error logs for troubleshooting.
6. Documentation and Deployment (1 Day)
Write component documentation, deployment guides, and configuration files.
Package the application into a JAR file.
Deploy the JAR on the Tomcat server and test in a real-world scenario.
