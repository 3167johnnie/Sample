Component Document: ACHCR_Validation Component
1. Overview
The ACHCR_Validation component is a scheduled Java application designed to process ACH (Automated Clearing House) file records stored in a database. It periodically updates the file status, generates return files, and logs the processing outcomes. The application integrates with an Oracle database and manages ACH file states through a sequence of validations and file generation tasks.

The component will be packaged as a JAR file and deployed in a Tomcat Server environment for scheduled execution.

2. Functional Specifications
Key Responsibilities:

Query the ACHHEADER table to identify records with FILE_STATUS = 10.
Update the file's status to indicate processing progress.
Generate a return file for each record and log the result.
Update the database with the final processing status and the generated return file name.
3. Technical Specifications
3.1 Prerequisites
Environment: Java 1.8+, Oracle 12c, Apache Tomcat 9+
Dependencies:
JDBC Driver for Oracle (ojdbc8.jar)
Java Timer API
Configuration:
Database connection settings (DB_URL, USER, PASS)
File output directory path (/output/path/)
3.2 Classes
1. ACHCR_Validation

Purpose: Main class to execute scheduled tasks every 2 minutes.
Responsibilities:
Connect to the database.
Fetch rows with FILE_STATUS = 10.
Process each row by invoking methods to generate return files and update the database.
2. ReturnFileGenerator_seq

Purpose: Generates return files for processed ACH records.
Responsibilities:
Creates a .txt file with the return data for a given ACHHEADER record.
Ensures the file directory exists and handles file creation exceptions.
3.3 Database Interactions
Table: ACHHEADER
Key Columns:
ID (Primary Key)
FILE_NAME
FILE_STATUS (10: Pending, 11: Processing, 12: Success, 13: Failure)
LAST_STATUS_TIME
RETURN_FILENAME
3.4 Workflow
Query ACHHEADER:

Fetch records where FILE_STATUS = 10.
Update Status to Processing:

Set FILE_STATUS = 11 and update LAST_STATUS_TIME.
Generate Return File:

Invoke ReturnFileGenerator_seq to create a .txt file.
Update Final Status:

On success, set FILE_STATUS = 12 and update RETURN_FILENAME.
On failure, set FILE_STATUS = 13.
4. Deployment Instructions
Build and Package:

Use Maven/Gradle to compile and package the code into a JAR file (e.g., ACHCR_Validation.jar).
Tomcat Deployment:

Place the JAR file in the lib folder of the Tomcat server.
Include a scheduled job configuration (if using an external scheduler) or ensure the application is set to run continuously.
Configuration Files:

Ensure a properties/configuration file (e.g., db.properties) is included for database connection and file paths.
Logging:

Enable log output for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes using System.out or integrate with logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j).
5. Configuration Details
Example db.properties:

properties
Copy code
DB_URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl
USER=SYS as SYSDBA
PASS=Root@123
OUTPUT_FILE_PATH=/output/path/
6. Key Error Handling
Database Connectivity:
Log connection issues and retry on failure.
File Generation:
Handle IOException and return null if file creation fails.
Data Integrity:
Ensure database updates are atomic (use transactions if necessary).
7. Post-Deployment Validation
Verify connectivity to the Oracle database.
Check log files for successful record processing and return file generation.
Confirm that records are updated correctly in the ACHHEADER table.
